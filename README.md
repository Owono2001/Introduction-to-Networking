For the Introduction to Networking assignment, our group designed and configured a Local Area Network (LAN) topology to connect two buildings in Kuala Lumpur and Penang for a company named Seagate. The aim was to plan and implement a network infrastructure using both wired and wireless connections, configuring devices like routers and switches through Cisco Packet Tracer simulation software. We employed advanced techniques such as Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) to efficiently allocate IP addresses across different departments within each building.

The project involved restructuring the existing network in Kuala Lumpur, which had outdated infrastructure, and creating a new, modern network setup for the Penang branch. We designed physical and logical topologies such as ring, star, and hybrid configurations to ensure seamless communication between the buildings and the various departments within each.

The network setup also included devices such as PCs, laptops, servers, printers, IP phones, and CCTV cameras, all configured to communicate effectively. Our work focused on ensuring successful data transmission and optimizing the overall performance of the network.
